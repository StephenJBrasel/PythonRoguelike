Tutorial Projects.

This is a follow-along project for "The Complete Roguelike Tutorial" using libtcod and pygame:

I'm using Python 3.6 instead of the tutorial's Python 2, so things may look a little different. 
I also got really tired of having to exit a menu via the toggle-button rather than being able to exit the entire game by the red X, 
so my menus look a little different as well. They have all the functions of the tutorial, though.
